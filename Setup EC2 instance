1. If you need to connect your Linux instance from windows using Putty, please follow
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html to complete the steps including:
- Convert Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen
- Connecting to Your Linux Instance
- Transferring Files to Your Linux Instance (If you are using Windows, you may need to transfer files from your local machine to the Instance)
Note: If you set the passphrase on a private key, you would use it when you open your session via Putty.
You can check your connect steps by clicking “Connect” on the top of your instance page.
change permission for key pair file

 chmod 400 [yourKeyPairName.pem]
run following in your terminal

 ssh -i [key pair file name] ec2-user@[ec2 public DNS name]
Example: ssh -i "natalie2.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-86-212-130.compute-1.amazonaws.com

type following in terminal:

 sudo yum update
 sudo yum install git
configure git and clone the repo

 git config --global credential.helper store
 git clone https://github.com/joanne-li/circex.git
 cd circex/
 git checkout aws-testing
 git pull
run make file

 cd ec2
 make install
If you are using Putty terminal

Even after installing python 3.6, running python --version in the Putty terminal still points to python 2.7, run following. sh alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3.6 python --version
