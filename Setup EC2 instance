<h1> Setup EC2 instance </h1>

<h2> Steps for spinning up ec2 instances with cloudformation</h2>

1. create key pair on ec2 console, download .pem file to local machine
2. go to cloudformation, go to `us-east-1` region, create stack with `spin_up_ec2.yml`, input stack name and choose your key pair under KeyName of Parameters session
Note: make sure that your stack is created completedly.  

3. go to ec2 console, click “Instances” on the Navigation Bar or “Running instances” button to check if your instance is ready and then record public DNS name.

<h2>ssh into ec2</h2>
1. If you need to connect your Linux instance from windows using Putty, please follow<br> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html to complete the steps including:<br>  
	- Convert Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen<br>  
	- Connecting to Your Linux Instance<br>  
	- Transferring Files to Your Linux Instance (If you are using Windows, you may need to transfer files from your local machine to the Instance)  <br>
	 Note: If you set the passphrase on a private key, you would use it when you open your session via Putty.  <br>
	You can check your connect steps by clicking “Connect” on the top of your instance page. <br>

2. change permission for key pair file
```
chmod 400 [yourKeyPairName.pem]
```
3. run following in your terminal

		ssh -i [key pair file name] ec2-user@[ec2 public DNS name]
	Example:
	ssh -i "natalie2.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-86-212-130.compute-1.amazonaws.com

4. type following in terminal:

		sudo yum update
		sudo yum install git

5. configure git and clone the repo

		git config --global credential.helper store
		git clone https://github.com/joanne-li/circex.git
		cd circex/
		git checkout aws-testing
		git pull

6. run make file

		cd ec2
		make install

7. If you are using Putty terminal

	Even after installing python 3.6, running python --version in the Putty terminal still points to python 2.7, run following.
		```sh
		alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3.6
		python --version
		```
